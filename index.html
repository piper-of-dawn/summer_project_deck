					<h1>Model Validation in Credit Risk</h1>

				<section>
					<h2>Hello</h2>
					<p>
						I did some cool stuff in credit risk management and I think it is worthwhile sharing it with you here. Credit risk and rating firms form a substantial portion of our college placements so this might help you. 
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>My experience at Citi</h2>
					
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Worked with some really cool people!</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">I did not write a single line of code!</p>

						<h2>JARGONS AHEAD!!</h2>
						<p>Let us walkthrough some banking jargons which might be helpful to you.</p>

						<h2>UNSECURED PORTFOLIOS</h2>
						<p>This is a jargon for credit cards.</p>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Ending Net Recievable (ENR)</h2>
						<p>The amount that is owed by clients to Citi at the end of the payment cycle.</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Gross Credit Losses (GCL%ENR)</h2>
						<p>The amount that is not paid on or before the billing date or deadline.</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Recoveries </h2>
						<p>The part of Gross Credit Losses recovered by Citi. </p>
						<br>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Net Credit Losses (NCL%ENR)</h2>
						<p>NCL = GCL - Recovery</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Deliquency Ratio</h2>
						<p>The proportion of portfolios that have delayed payments. Deliquent portfolios / Total portfolios</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Deliquency Buckets </h2>
						<p> 
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">30 DPD</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">60 DPD</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">120 DPD</p>
						</p>

						<h2>FICO Score</h2>
						<p> 
						FICO, originally Fair, Isaac and Company, is a data analytics company which credit rates individuals and businesses. Its ratings are widely used in credit risk analytics.
						</p>
						<br>
						</section>
						
						<section>
						<h2>Lifetime of an asset</h2>
						<p> 
						If a loan is due to be paid in 10 years then the lifetime of the asset is 10 years.
						</p>
						<br>
						</section>
						
						<section>
						<h2>Instalment Segment</h2>
						<p> 
						When the principle is pre-determined at the beginning of the lifetime of the asset and the loan is paid in regular instalments.
						</p>
						<br>
						</section>
						
						<section>
						<h2>Revolving Segment</h2>
						<p> 
						When the principle itself is a random variable. Eg: Credit Cards
						</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					
					<section>
						<h2>Rewrite Segment</h2>
						<p> 
						When the defaulted bad loans are reconverted into another asset. 
						</p>
						<br>
						</section>
					
					<section>
						<h2>Now the most important: CCAR</h2>
						<p> 
						Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is a United States regulatory framework introduced by the Federal Reserve to assess, regulate, and supervise large banks and financial institutions â€“ collectively referred to in the framework as bank holding companies (BHCs). There are similar regulator frameworks such as IFRS-9 etc.
						</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Model Validation </h2>
						<p> 
						The fundamental objective of Risk Assessment is making predictions. Predictions are data driven. Generally large banks use models made out of every prediction algo ever discovered. Eg: There are models based on Regression, autoregressive moving averages, Machine learning, dynamic ML, deep learning etc etc.... No matter what kind of model it is, it has to go through a rigorous validation procedure before it is used for predictive analytics. 
						</p>
						</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>A short overview of testing procedure</h2>
						<h3>Stage 1 of model testing</h3>
					
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">GP1: Current state of portfolio</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">GP2: Similarity between current state and the Go forward state of portfolio</p>
					    <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">GP3: Senstivity to training values</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">GP4: </p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">GP5: Segmentation and Clustering</p>
						
						
						</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Stage 2 of model testing</h2
					<h3>Stress testing</h3>
					<p> Model is given data shocks which are stress values and we see how model performs in such a scenario </p>
					
						</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Stage 3 of model testing</h2
					<h3>Back testing</h3>
					<p> Model predictions are tested when actual values are realised. And we examine if model is able to predict it with accuracy</p>
